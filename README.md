My profiles for the RGB2HDMI

I often come up with RGB2HDMI profiles while making videos. I always submit these to the maintainer of the project for includion in releases,
but in the meantime I will also upload them here in case you find a video of mine and want the profile I was using.

Download the profile and put it on the SD card of your RGB2HDMI in the profiles directory. 

Profiles:

Commodore PET (CRTC models) 40 columns
Graphic is the typical screen height on graphic modesl like the 4016. 
Business is the typical screen height on the business model like the ... well I'm not sure. 

I haven't tested this on 80 column machines, so I assume it while it may work, it may not look right. YMMV!

These profiles were first used in this video: (You can see connection information as well)
