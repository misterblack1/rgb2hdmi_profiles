My profiles for the RGB2HDMI

I often come up with RGB2HDMI profiles while making videos. I always submit these to the maintainer of the project for includion in releases,
but in the meantime I will also upload them here in case you find a video of mine and want the profile I was using.

Download the profile and put it on the SD card of your RGB2HDMI in the profiles directory.
